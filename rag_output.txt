**1. Concentration**
- **SHAP Value**: -0.547 (strong negative impact)
- **Explanation**: The low concentration of sperm significantly reduces the chances of achieving a natural pregnancy, contributing to the low fertility score of 5.48%.
- **Intervention**: Personalized interventions to improve sperm concentration may include lifestyle changes, dietary modifications, and medical treatments to boost sperm production (Smith et al., 2020).

**2. Motility**
- **SHAP Value**: -3.244 (strong negative impact)
- **Explanation**: Poor sperm motility hampers the ability of sperm to reach and fertilize the egg, leading to a decreased probability of natural pregnancy.
- **Intervention**: Interventions to enhance sperm motility could involve antioxidant supplements, regular exercise, and avoiding factors that contribute to sperm damage (Showell et al., 2014).

**3. Volume**
- **SHAP Value**: +0.009 (weak positive impact)
- **Explanation**: While volume has a minor positive impact on fertility, it is not sufficient to offset the strong negative impacts of concentration and motility.
- **Intervention**: Strategies to improve sperm volume may include staying hydrated, reducing stress levels, and addressing underlying health issues affecting sperm production (Jungwirth et al., 2018).

**Summary**
- **Prioritize**: Addressing sperm motility and concentration should be the primary focus due to their strong negative impacts on fertility.
- **Recommend**: Steps to maximize fertility probability should include lifestyle changes, dietary supplements, and medical treatments tailored to improving sperm quality.
- **Treatment Recommendation**: IVF with ICSI is highly likely. This means doctors use special methods to help with pregnancy.

By addressing the factors contributing to low fertility, individuals can enhance their chances of achieving a successful natural pregnancy within 12 months.
